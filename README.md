# Chrome-Passwords-to-Google-Form
When you request Google Chrome to save your password on a given website, it stores it in a "Login Data" file (sqlite database file).<br>
In order to securely store the password, the password is encrypted using user's window's credentials. <br>
This program decrypts the passwords in user's machine and then sends them to the Google forms whose post request parameters are given.<br>
So if the executable version of this program is plugged into any computer running Windows and Google Chrome, <br>
running this program will send all the Chrome saved passwords to the Google Form. <br>
Please dont misuse this program. I will not be responsible for any destructive outcomes of this program.<br>
